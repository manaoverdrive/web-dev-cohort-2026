# 🚀 Cursor Dev Tool Landing Page — Clone  
**Web Dev Cohort 2026**

This project is a **desktop-first HTML & CSS clone** of the **Cursor developer tool landing page**, built as part of the **Web Dev Cohort 2026 CSS assignment**.

The objective of this assignment is **visual and structural accuracy** — not creativity or interactivity.  
The focus is on closely matching the original Cursor website’s **layout, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy**.
